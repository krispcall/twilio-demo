### Working of KrispCall


KrispCall is a communication application that offers reliable and high-quality communication
services by utilizing Twilio's API and SDK. Twilio's Voice API is used for making and 
receiving voice calls, Messaging API for SMS messaging, and Video API for video calls, 
while Twilio's SDKs are utilized for custom communication experiences. This ensures 
seamless communication services for KrispCall users, no matter their location.
In addition, KrispCall features workspaces and user channels. Each workspace can have 
two or more channels, which allows users to organize their communication based on 
specific projects or teams. KrispCall also offers subscription plans to its users, which are 
implemented using Chargebee. With Chargebee, KrispCall is able to manage and automate
its subscription billing, invoicing, and payments while providing a seamless user experience.
These features combined allow KrispCall to provide a comprehensive and customizable 
communication solution to its users.
